# developer-environment-setup

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ottenwbe/developer-environment-setup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ottenwbe/developer-environment-setup)

This ansible playbook is used by me to automate the setup of my Linux developer machines. Therefore, this repository will be updated whenever I setup a new machine (commits to master).

## Supported Linux Distributions

Right now the only supported Distribution is:
* Fedora (26,27)

Formerly supported:
* Ubuntu

## Structure

```

## Usage 

First of all, clone this repository.

```
    git clone https://github.com/ottenwbe/developer-environment-setup.git
```

The ```bootstrap_local.sh``` script installs ansible as a prerequisite for executing the playbook.
On a local Fedora installation where ansible is __not__ installed the playbook can be executed as follows:

```bash
sh bootstrap_local.sh hosts <your user> Fedora
```

On a local Linux installation where ansible is installed the playbook can be executed as follows:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --connection=local --extra-vars "user=<your user>" --ask-become-pass
```

## Testing 

The playbook can be tested in a Docker container---more or less.

### Docker


__NOTE__: On an SELinux, i.e., Fedora, first execute the following command in the root directory of the project.

```bash
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t "${PWD}"
```

On a non SELinux you can simply build a docker image and execute the playbook in a container. Replace 'your name' with a username that suits you and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo docker build --rm=true --file=test/docker/Dockerfile.fedora27 --tag=fedora27:ansible test/docker
sudo docker run --detach --volume="${PWD}":/home/ansible:ro fedora27:ansible "/sbin/init" > cid
sudo docker exec --tty "$(cat cid)" env TERM=xterm ansible-playbook -i /home/ansible/test/docker/test_hosts /home/ansible/site.yml --connection=local --become --extra-vars "user=<your user>" --skip-tags "systemd"
```

__Note__: We skip everything related to systemd, since systemd is not monitoring our services in the container.  

After the test has finished you can stop the container:
```bash
sudo docker stop "$(cat cid)"
```

### [Deprecated]: Vagrant

Since Ubuntu is no longer in the focus of this project, tests are mainly focused on Fedora and Docker.

```bash
cd test/vagrant
./test.sh # Executes vagrant up, halt and destroy 
```
